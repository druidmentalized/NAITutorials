# MLTasks ‚Äì Java Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a set of Java-based machine learning tasks developed for the **MPP (Machine Learning in Java)** course at [Your Institution]. Each task focuses on a different algorithm or concept, supported by reusable dataset-preparation and evaluation modules.

---

## üìÅ Structure

Each task is located under its own package inside the `src/main/java/org/ml/` (or `com.example.ml`) directory:

- **`Main.java`** - Entry point of the program
- **`data/`** ‚Äì Utilities for parsing CSV files, splitting data into train/test sets, and encoding labels.
- **`evaluation/`** ‚Äì Contains evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
- **`main/`** - Main classes
- **`models/`** - Different classifying models
- **`plot/`** - Plotting utilities
- **`structures/`** - Basic structures used all over the program
- **`utils/`** ‚Äì Utility needed for the program

## üîç Topics Covered

- **Task 1: Perceptron**
    - Implements the **Delta Rule** (gradient-based) for a single-layer perceptron.
    - Demonstrates **binary classification** on a 2D subset of the Iris dataset.
    - Shows how to plot the **decision boundary** in ASCII or export boundary points to a CSV file.

- **Task 2: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
    - Implements a basic **KNN classifier** with a custom sorting routine and tie-breaking logic.
    - Demonstrates **multi-class classification** on the Iris dataset.
    - Explores how changing **k** affects prediction accuracy.

- **Shared Utilities**
    - **`LabelEncoder`** for converting string labels (e.g., `"setosa"`) to integers and back.
    - **`PrepareDataset`** for parsing CSVs and performing **stratified train-test splits**.
    - **`EvaluationMetrics`** for computing accuracy and (optionally) confusion matrices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Open in Your IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or build from the command line using Maven.
3.	Run any of the tasks:
      - Main Class: org.ml.Main (or another entry point, depending on your structure).
      - The console prompts will guide you to choose a classifier, input vectors, etc.
4.	Plotting:
      - Some tasks use ASCII plots for quick visualization.
      - Boundary points can also be exported to CSV and viewed in Excel, Python (matplotlib), or another plotting tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
-	Java 17+ (tested with Java 17, should work with newer versions)
-	Maven (for dependency management and building)
-	No external libraries for core tasks (except optional libraries for advanced plotting)

## üß© How to Extend
- Add a new algorithm:
- Create a new package, e.g., org.ml.naivebayes/.
- Implement the Classifier interface or create your own.
- Use the shared dataset and evaluation modules to keep consistency.
- Add new metrics:
- Extend EvaluationMetrics with new methods (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
- Add advanced plotting:
- If allowed, you can integrate a library like JFreeChart or XChart for better visualizations.
